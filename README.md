# cracktip_sif_dic
The code is written in Matlab.


This is to detect the crack tip and the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) from a displacement field during the fracture. The displacement is evaluated using the DIC.


Run the main.m file


The data.mat file contains the pre-defined crack path the experimental displacement field.


The example evaluates the crack tip and the SIF for a chosen displacment field during the fracture extracted using the DIC.


The crack tip is plotted on the image with the crack path and the crack tip, SIF values are shown on the command window
